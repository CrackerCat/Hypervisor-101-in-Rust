# Motivation
- Hypervisors are
  - Cool
    - Foundation of cloud-platforms: KVM (GCP), Hyper-V (Azure), Nitro Hypervisor (AWS), Oracle Cloud (Xen)
  - Interesting
    - Foundation of major security features: Virtualization Based Security, Secured-core PC (Platform Properties Assessment Module)
    - Used in security research: [BitVisor](https://github.com/matsu/bitvisor/tree/master/core), Intel's [Virtualization Based Hardening](https://github.com/intel/vbh)
  - Convenient
    - System-level isolation: VMware Workstation/Fusion, [ACRN](https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor), Nitro Hypervisor, [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/)
    - System-level inspection: [Asahi Linux m1n1 Hypervisor](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1), [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/), [HVMI](https://github.com/hvmi), [kAFL/Nyx](https://nyx-fuzz.com/), [Cheat Engine DBVM](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/), [Blue Pill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Pill_(software)), antivirus-hypervisors (eg, Avast Premium Security)
